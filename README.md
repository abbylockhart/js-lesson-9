# CLG ASSIGNMENT 9
Lesson 9 : AJAX and Fetch API

INSTRUCTIONS
I have worked on changing the layout of the website to make it more functional as a blog.

Using a weather / water temp API, you can find out: current weather forecast, temp and humidity, as well as an estimated water temp, trail distance and difficulty level for each trail.
I have logged the data from the API on the blog page under each trail.
